    Send shutdown and Wake-on-LAN commands to computers within your local network.\n\nBased on
        \'Wake on Lan\' by Mr.Webb and \'Remote Shutdown\' by Isah Rikovic as an Android/Kotlin learning exercise.
        Both available on Google Play.

        To use the remote shutdown feature and get device\'s hostname and MAC, please download the

    Send shutdown and Wake-on-LAN commands to computers within your local network.\n\n
    Use &#x27F3; gesture on device list to refresh their status in main screen.\n\n
    When using the \"🔍 Scan local network\" option the app will try to scan common ports
    to determine if the device is online. Using this feature will also ensure that if the
    \"Remote PC Control Tray\" is running if any of the devices it will return its host name
    and MAC address automatically.
    \n\nPlease keep in mind that due to Android security restrictions sometimes this
    scan doesn\"t return the expected results and some \"online\" machines would not appear.\n\n
    Another source of trouble is the way modern PCs enter hibernation/suspension and how the OS and BIOS
    manage ports in suspension.During hibernation/suspension some computers will appear as &#x1F534; offline,
    while others will be shown as &#x1F7E2; online or correctly shown as &#x1F7E0; hibernated/suspended.\n\n
    When a PC goes into sleep or hibernation, each model decides which hardware parts stay \"awake\".
    The BIOS or UEFI may keep some network ports active for features like waking the computer remotely,
    but in other cases it turns them off to save power. The operating system can also limit or disable these
    ports depending on its power settings. That’s why two seemingly identical computers can behave
    differently: one keeps the network port listening while the other completely shuts it down during sleep.</string>
