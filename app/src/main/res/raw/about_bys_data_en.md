To use **remote shutdown** and to automatically retrieve additional device information,
a companion application must be running on the target computer.

Please install **Remote PC Control Tray** on each computer you want to control:

**Wake-on-LAN** does not require any software on the target device, but it must be supported and enabled in the system BIOS/firmware and operating system.
