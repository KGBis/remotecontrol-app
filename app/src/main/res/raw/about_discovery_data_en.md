Due to Android security restrictions introduced in recent versions, it is no longer possible for apps to freely inspect the local network (for example by using ICMP ping or reading the ARP table).

Device discovery is performed by multicast discovery service (_mDNS_) when **Remote PC Control Tray** is running on a computer.
If not installed, the device can still be added manually.

_Note: Make sure that your devices are turned on. Device discovery will only work for devices that are turned on._
