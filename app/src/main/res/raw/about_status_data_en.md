The device status shown in the main list is based on network reachability and service responses.

In some situations —such as sleep, hibernation, or aggressive power-saving modes— devices may report unexpected states.\
This behavior depends largely on hardware vendors, BIOS settings, and operating system configuration.

If a device appears offline while it is powered on, a common cause is a change in IP address when using DHCP.

Assigning a static IP address on the router or updating the device IP in the app usually resolves this issue.
